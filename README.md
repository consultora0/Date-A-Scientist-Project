# Date-A-Scientist-Project

In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we’ve never had before about how different people experience romance

The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to answer those questions. 

## Project Scoping
Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for your project, but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.

## Select ML-Solvable Problem
First select a problem that you can answer using a machine learning approach. Make sure that this problem can be solved in a reasonable amount of time and with available data. Also, if the problem is too complex, it might be worth breaking it down into smaller units.

## Load and Check Data
If supervised learning will be used, check that the data has a label or response variable. If the data is missing a crucial piece for analysis, go back to the previous step to select a different problem to solve.

## Preprocess Data
Once you have a good understanding of your data, it is time to get it prepared for modeling. These steps can involve joining data, standardizing variables, removing variables, imputation, and splitting data into train and test sets.

## Build Model(s)
Once the data is preprocessed, it is ready to model. Select the appropriate type(s) of models to solve your problem. Once you have your models, run your data through each model and store your results.

## Evaluate Model(s)
Once the model(s) are created, you need to use the metric of success that was defined to evaluate the model performance(s). Find the accuracy, precision, and recall of each model you used, and create graphs showing how they changed. If you aren’t satisfied with your results you can repeat the previous step.

## Conclusions
Finally we can wrap up the project. You can write a conclusion about your process and findings.

Next Steps
Lastly, being a data scientist is about making continual progress. What are future-looking takeaways and limitations? If you were to do this project again, how could you extend this analysis?

Create a Slide Deck
Once you’ve performed your analysis, you’re ready to create your slide deck. One of the most important parts of Data Analysis is being able to communicate your findings.
